Docker compose can be used to combine more than one docker Containers simultaneously, where they are able to **interact** with each other.


eg: A node.js app and a db/api service running on Django.py

_nb: database is hard.. so is my will to live.. so no db_

`docker-compose up` used to run all the required containers together

>Note: copy-pasta the [yaml](./docker-compose.yml) file to the [Prev Day folder](/10AUG24/)


Good Luck and God-speed!âš¡
